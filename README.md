# KorGE Zombie Bird
A Flappy Bird Remake using KorGE.

## Origin
This app is heavily based on [Kilobolt's LibGDX Zombie Bird Tutorial](http://www.kilobolt.com/zombie-bird-tutorial-flappy-bird-remake.html).

I've tried to ask if I can do that but the help web site isn't working and there is no response via e-mail:

```
Hi!

We no longer offer technical support via email. If you need assistance with coding or have general questions, please see help.kilobolt.com for a quick response!

For all other inquiries, we will get back to you as soon as possible.

Kind regards,

```

I've tried to find other contact methods but there has been no success. So I've decided that there is no prohibition to use that tutorial in derivative works.

## Plans
- [ ] Implement it fully. By the way, it's my first KorGE project.
- [ ] Resolve TODOs [left in code](https://github.com/SerVB/korge-zombie-bird/search?q=todo&unscoped_q=todo) and refactor (investigate patterns in other KorGE samples) &mdash; code from LibGDX tutorial is quite low-level.
- [ ] Set up GitHub actions to build the game for the most platforms.
- [ ] Write a tutorial in English and publish it at <https://habr.com/en> (it's going to be huge).
- [ ] Make a translation to Russian and publish it at <https://habr.com/ru>.

Any feedback on any stage will be appreciated! I will also ask many questions in Slack at every stage myself ;)

## Credits
